I’m 7 years old. My name is Masha. Every day I wake up at 7 a.m. and go to the bathroom. I brush my teeth, brush my hair and go to have some breakfast. My mother is a chef, so she cooks very well. My father is a doctor. He usually reads a paper in the morning. We have a cat. Its name is Bars. We are a small and happy family.My sister is 20 years old and she works at the City Zoo. She sees a lot of animals. There is a big elephant and a crocodile, several monkeys and a lion. I want to see a snake and a giraffe there. We will go there on the weekend. I will see bears, penguins, horses, squirrels, foxes and rabbits. I will enjoy our family holiday.
