My sister is 20 years old and she works at the City Zoo. She sees a lot of animals. There is a big elephant and a crocodile, several monkeys and a lion. I want to see a snake and a giraffe there. We will go there on the weekend. I will see bears, penguins, horses, squirrels, foxes and rabbits. I will enjoy our family holiday.
